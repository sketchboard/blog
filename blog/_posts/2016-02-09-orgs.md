We're excited to announce Sketchboard for organizations. Now Sketchboard scales for your needs, you can start from a small sketch diagramming team and scale your visual communication needs to any size.

Organization allows easily to **separate work** between different teams. Teammates can edit or view boards only if they belong to a team. You can have unlimited private teams. Organization users can belong to multiple project teams or cross functional units within your organization with simple understandable access right that is a team.

**Examples**

- Product Manager belongs to multiple development project teams
- Separate teams for each development project
- Team to communicate with a client and clearly separate team internal and client visible boards
- Support team
- Team for HR people
- Internal training team where only some of the users can edit team boards

Teams help you to clearly and easily separate who is able to access your team boards. **Team is a security unit**. Only team members can access private team boards within a team.

In addition organization's have a **new team level access right**, read-only team member. When subscribing to an organization plan you are able to [change team member roles](https://sketchboard.io/help/faq#roles).

## Simplified Pricing

Organizations' have simplified pricing. No need to update your subscription when new users join to an organization team. Pricing is $9 per user per month. Organization grows or shrinks by calculating daily users with in all organization's teams. One user can belong to a multiple teams and is calculated only once. Read more about how [organization billing](https://sketchboard.io/help/faq#org-add-prorated) is done. **Note that minimum charged organization size is 15 users**.

Organization unifies billing for all teams and teams do not need to worry about subscription. You have a single invoice for the whole organization.

Organizations' have [increased storage space](https://sketchboard.io/help/faq#org-storage) for images and board snapshot versions.

Sketching is fun and together with teammates it is even more fun, but sometimes teammates are not online at the same time. You might want to add some explanation, track open ideas or have questions to your teammates. So you write an email and send it to your teammates. Information is then distributed in different channels and you need to link to the board manually. That's a little bit of trouble, but that's in the past now.

Sketchboard.io's newest feature Markdown Comments allows you to add comments on a board level or on a shape level. Comments are like mini chats. Those work in real-time and moves along with the board.

Email notifications are sent to teammates that are not online with you. Notification shows newest comment and comment history. You can even use it to notify teammates that you have updated the sketch. **Note**, board needs to be shared within the team before notifications are sent.

You can resolve comments to track e.g. open items or elaborate tasks before those are actual tasks that should be part of your task manager like Trello.

Usage Guide
-----------

For prototyping and testing responses you can create e.g. following Slash command in Slack:

<img width='100%' alt='Slack Command Integration Settings' src='/slack/images/slash-command-integ-setting.png'>

URL:
<pre class="code">
<code>https://sketchboard.me/api/v1/command/:application\_secret\_key</code>
</pre>

After creating a Slash command, Slack channel supports following Sketchboard commands:

- **/devsketch user@email.com** - Starts visual sharing with existing Sketchboard team
- **/devsketch user@email.com Board Name** - Starts visual sharing with existing Sketchboard team with a named board
- **/devsketch admin@email.com add @username** - Adds Slack teammate to your Sketchboard team
- **/devsketch admin@email.com add name@email.com** - Adds someone to your Sketchboard team not on your Slack team


<aside>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>user@email.com needs to be a user in Sketchboard.</li>
			<li>admin@email.com needs to be a team admin in Sketchboard.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</aside>


Response
--------

- **res: 0** indicates success

Slack Integration with Command Line API
---------------------------------------

Slack can initiate Sketchboard session using Slash command conventions. Slash command can be sent almost as is. Current user needs to be sent and @username command line references need to be changed to Slack account related email addresses.

<ul>
	<li><strong>/devsketch user@email.com</strong> - user@email.com should be current Slack user account email address</li>
	<li><strong>/devsketch user@email.com add @username</strong> - @username should be changed to Slack user account email address</li>
</ul>

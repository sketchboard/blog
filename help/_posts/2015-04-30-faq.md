<h3 id="update-plan">Updating Plan</h3>

Sketchboard.io uses Stripe **prorated costs** on plan switch. Current plan unused remaining time is credited and new plan remaining time is added to the invoice.

For example, say your current plan cost is $10 per month. Your billing period starts 1st of each month and you switch plan in the middle of the billing cycle. In that case, you have already paid $10, and used half of the current billing cycle.

When you switch to the new plan, with a cost of $25, the unused portion of the previous plan results in a credit of $5. The cost of the new plan for the rest of the billing cycle will be $12.50. Therefore, the total prorated cost of switching from the cheaper plan to the expensive plan is $12.50 - $5 = $7.50. This amount will be added to the next invoice and next invoice is $7.50 + $25 = $32.50

When you switch subscription plans in the middle of a billing period to plan with **different billing frequency**. For example monthly to yearly. You will be charged immediately with prorated costs.

<h3 id='org-add-prorated'>Adding new users to an organization. How is that billed?</h3>

Organization plan starts from 15 users. New users are automatically added to your organization when you add new teammates to any of your organization's teams. Number of users in an organization is checked daily. One user can belong to multiple teams, but will be charged only once.

Team member invitations to an organization team are not calculated to as an active user. Only when user has accepted an organization team, user is part of the organization.

When you add more than 15 different users to your organization, a new organization user will be prorated for the remainder of the current billing period. This is tracked automatically for you and added on your next bill.

<h3 id='org-delete-prorated'>Delete user from an organization</h3>
Sketchboard checks daily how many different users there are in the organization. When user is deleted from your organization you will have prorated credit in your next bill.

**Note** that minimum charge for organization is 15 users. If you need smaller plans you can choose separate team plans.

<h3 id='org-storage'>Storage space for organizations</h3>

Organizations' have more storage space. Storage space is calculated per user in the organization.
For each user in the organization, storage space is increased with 1 GB. E.g. if you have 15 users in your
organization your will have 15 GB of storage space for all your organizations' teams available
for images and board versions.

<h3 id='roles'>Roles</h3>

Sketchboard has four different team roles.

- Team Primary Owner
- Team Admin
- Team member (read-write)
- Team read-only member (only in organization teams)

Teams can have one single primary owner who has created a team.
Only primary owner has rights to delete the team. There can be only one team primary owner.

Primary owner and other admins can promote other teammates as team admins. Team admins can invite new and delete existing team members.

Team members can edit and view all team boards. In case you have an organization plan, you can also set members as read-only. Read-only users cannot modify any boards, not even the ones they have created, if they used to have higher team access rights.

Access rights are inherited from weakest rights to strongest.

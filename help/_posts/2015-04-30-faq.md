<h3 id="update-plan">Updating Plan</h3>

Sketchboard.io uses Stripe **prorated costs** on plan switch. Current plan unused remaining time is credited and new plan remaining time is added to the invoice.

For example, say your current plan cost is $10 per month. Your billing period starts 1st of each month and you switch plan in the middle of the billing cycle. In that case, you have already paid $10, and used half of the current billing cycle.

When you switch to the new plan, with a cost of $25, the unused portion of the previous plan results in a credit of $5. The cost of the new plan for the rest of the billing cycle will be $12.50. Therefore, the total prorated cost of switching from the cheaper plan to the expensive plan is $7.50. This amount will be added to the next invoice and next invoice is $7.50 + $25 = $32.50

When you switch subscription plans in the middle of a billing period to plan with **different billing frequency**. For example monthly to yearly. You will be charged immediately with prorated costs.

Share Private Board Outside your Team
-------------------------------------

Password sharing can be used to share private personal or team board outside of your team. You need to share password separately to correct stakeholders. Note that anyone with the password and URL can edit the board. Sketchboard support password sharing up to 3 simultaneous user per board. 

Set password for a board from:

Share Public Board
------------------

Public boards can be shared just by sending the board link either through email, chat or similar media.

Public board might be completely public where anyone can **view** and **edit the board**. Board is completely public until it is accessed by someone who has **logged in** on Sketchboard.io. First logged in user that access the board takes the board ownership.

Anyone can view **owned public boards** as well, but only teammates can edit owned public boards.
